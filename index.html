<p>Now that bullying has taken root in cyberspace, society has a new, and more virulent, form of the age-old problem. People with bad intentions — criminals and bullies — are very adept at learning to use new technology to their advantage. Hackers have been hacking since computers were invented and abusive personalities have found a new tool to replace their megaphones. Bullies take to cyberspace because they know that they have an easy way to reach their targets — often walking right into the abusers’ line of fire willingly.</p>

<p>Social media sites are one of the leading places that pre-teens and teens experience bullying, whether they are being bullied, bullying someone or witnessing it. What is staggering is that 90% of those who witnessed bullying on their social media sites have ignored the behavior.
	Cyber predation is "behind-the-scenes bullying." It's the electronic transmission of damaging words and photos, and it allows predators to reach victims stealthily and anonymously through online means. Unlike physical oppressors, cyberbullies can torment students 24/7, relying on tools like social media platforms, instant messaging, email, blogs and websites rather than face-to-face encounters.</p>

<p>According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry , cyberbullying exacerbated symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in predisposed adolescents. The children in the study came from challenging backgrounds, and cyberbullying still had a more forceful impact than other indicators in worsening depressive symptoms.
	Further, the study suggested a vicious cycle. Those who were already depressed or suffering from mental health issues were more likely to be bullied online than those who did not suffer from mental health issues. The researchers said that their work confirmed the results of previous studies.
